## 🏫 1. Campus Query Assistant  
**Problem:** New students often struggle with campus facilities, rules, and processes.  

**Solution:**  
Train a **Large Language Model (LLM)** on your college’s **handbook, FAQs, and campus maps** → students can ask anything like:  
- "Where’s the lab?"  
- "How do I apply for leave?"  
- "What’s the Wi-Fi password?"  

**Extra Twist:**  
- 🎙️ Voice-based interaction  
- 🗺️ Map integration for **directions to locations on campus**  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (**RAG**)  
- GPT-4 or LLaMA  
- Vector DB (**FAISS**, **Pinecone**)

## 📄 2. Research Paper Simplifier  
**Problem:** Academic papers are often **too complex** to understand quickly.  

**Solution:**  
Upload a **PDF research paper** → LLM extracts:  
- Abstract summary  
- Main findings  
- Methodology  
- Limitations  

…all simplified into **plain English** for quick grasp.  

**Extra Twist:**  
- 🧩 Flashcard mode → auto-generate Q&A cards for revision  
- 🔍 Concept highlighter for quick scanning  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python + LangChain  
- PDF parsing tools (PyPDF, pdfplumber)  
- LLM (GPT-4, Claude, or LLaMA)

## 📜 3. Campus Policy Explainer  
**Problem:** College policies (hostel rules, attendance, leave, etc.) are buried in PDFs nobody reads.  

**Solution:**  
An AI **policy bot** trained on official campus policy documents. Students ask in **natural language**, e.g.:  
- "How many days of leave can I take without a medical certificate?"  
- "What happens if I miss more than 25% of classes?"  

**Extra Twist:**  
- 🌍 Multi-language support for regional students  
- 🧠 Contextual memory (remembers your profile while answering)  

**Tech Stack:**  
- LLM fine-tuned on PDFs  
- Translation APIs (Google Translate / MarianMT)  
- Web + Mobile UI
